# Enchanted Kingdoms

A simulation and storytelling project exploring dynamic systems through narrative-driven educational tools.

## Repository Structure
- **code/notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for simulation and analysis.
- **docs/**: Project documentation, including assignments and rubrics.
- **storybook/**: Placeholder for narrative elements (currently empty).
- **visuals/**: Organized folders for graphs and animations (currently empty).
- **archive/**: Contains older or unused materials for reference.

## Current Contents
- Jupyter Notebooks: Simulation notebooks located in `code/notebooks/` (e.g., `EK2.ipynb`).
- Documentation: Includes `assignment.md` and `rubric.md` in `docs/`.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:beckerbeckerbecker/COMS7900.git

   ## Planned Additions
The following sections will be added to the repository as the project progresses:

1. **Three Body Problem Simulation**:
   - A Jupyter notebook (`three_body_problem.ipynb`) to simulate and analyze the Three Body Problem.

2. **Children's Book Extension**:
   - A narrative markdown file (`childrens_book.md`) to explore storybook-inspired elements.

3. **Tintin-Inspired Narrative**:
   - A markdown file (`tintin_extension.md`) integrating narrative themes inspired by Tintin.

These components will be integrated into their respective directories when ready.

## Repository Structure
- **code/ODE/**: Python scripts for ODE simulations (e.g., Three Body Problem).
- **code/notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis.
- **storybook/**: Drafts for Children's Book and Tintin-inspired content.
- **docs/**: Notes and supporting documents.
- **visuals/**: Graphs and animations from simulations.

- # Tintin Three Body Problem Project

This repository combines simulation and narrative elements inspired by the Three Body Problem and Tintin's investigative adventures.

## Repository Structure
- `code/`: Python scripts for simulations and visualizations.
- `narratives/`: Story outline and project narrative.
- `docs/`: Documentation of findings and numerical methods.
- `assets/`: Visuals, images, and animations.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git`
2. Navigate to the `code/` folder and run the simulation scripts using Python.
3. Explore the narrative and findings in the `narratives/` and `docs/` folders.
