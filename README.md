# Surreal numbers in Python

Surreal numbers are a fascinating branch of pure mathematics.  A surreal number can 
be written as {L|R} where both L and R are sets of Surreal numbers.  A surreal number is
well formed if every member of L is less-than or equal to every member of R.

This module provides a Surreal number object as well as a helper function for creating
surreals from their string shorthands.

	from surreal import Surreal as S, shorthand
	
'''    python
# The zero surreal number
s = Surreal(set(), set())
s = shorthand('0')
'''
This readme is still a work-in-progress.
