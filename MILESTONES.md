## Core Assignment Milestones
### Deliverables
1. **Numerical Simulation and Analysis**:
   - Finalize and validate the Three Body Problem simulation script.
   - Analyze stability and chaos points in the simulation results.
   - Document key insights:
     - Stability and chaos analysis.
     - Sensitivity to initial conditions.
   - Save outputs and ensure the data is reusable for visuals and documentation.

2. **Visualization**:
   - Generate static trajectory plots (`.png`) to illustrate the dynamics.
   - Create animations (`.gif` or `.mp4`) to showcase orbital behaviors.
   - Integrate visuals into the findings and documentation.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Summarize findings and methods in `numerical_findings.md`.
   - Create a polished summary (Markdown or PDF) for presentation and submission.
   - Ensure the documentation clearly communicates the main assignment deliverables.

## Creative Enhancement Milestones
### Deliverables
1. **Story-Driven Narrative**:
   - Outline a creative narrative framework in `tintin_three_body_project.md`.
   - Draft and integrate the story with the simulation findings.
   - Connect the creative elements to the main assignment without overshadowing it.

2. **Enhanced Visuals**:
   - Overlay thematic elements onto simulation visuals where appropriate.
   - Use these visuals to support both the narrative and the core assignment.

3. **Final Presentation**:
   - Combine the core findings and narrative framework into a cohesive presentation.
   - Create a multimedia summary (PDF, visuals, or animations) for the final output.

## General Approach
- Prioritize the **Core Assignment Milestones** to ensure the main deliverables are completed first.
- Treat the **Creative Enhancements** as supplementary work to enhance the final output without detracting from the core goals.
- Use powerful tools and resources to accelerate progress when available.
