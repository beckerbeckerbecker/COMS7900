# Abstract

Based on careful research, we have created a detailed ecological model of Enchanted Kingdoms using both system dynamics and agent-based modeling methodologies.  Specifiically, we have submitted the Prince-Frog and the Princess-Sleeping Beauty co-linked ecological cycles.  We compare the results from the two modeling approaches for this problem, including the regulation mechanisms of kiss effectiveness and witch density.  Using our models, we can make predictions about population dynamics and the regulation mechanisms needed for a quasi-stable system.
