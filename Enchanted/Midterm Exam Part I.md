Part I: Numerical Experiments of Enchanted Kingdoms.

Using the ODE and agent-based modeling codes in the Enchanted Kingdoms project, do the following analysis.  You have already created a “methods” section and background.  You are now working on the analysis section for this project.  

Determine how the kissing and cursing factors affect the quasi-stable population using a set of numerical simulations.  This is not simply a question of “does the population crash?”  You should analyze the population of each element as determined by factors.  You will need to explore parameter space in depth, display the data, and then analyze these results.  The first step will be defining a set of runs you will make using the code for this work.  You should assume- at least at first – that you have a balance population of princes and princesses with zero frogs and sleeping beauties.  I would also suggest starting with a fixed number (or density) of witches.  You can revisit this assumption later.  

After you determine the set of runs you need to complete, you will need to determine the code parameters you need to do these runs.  For the agent-based code, you need to show that you have sufficient resolution to get reliable results for the population outcomes.  The free parameters are grid size, initial population sizes, and the number of iterations. You will also need to determine how to compare the results between the two codes.

Once you have determined the runs you need and determined the resolution needed for the analysis, do the runs and analyze the results.  The goal is an understanding of the ecology of this system and how the free parameters (kissing and cursing) affect the outcomes.

Compare how the results from the two modeling approaches differ under this analysis.  Can you normalize the two factors (and perhaps adjust the population/grid size) so the results are similar?  Interpret what the physical interpretation of this normalization process means.  (For example, are we modeling population densities instead of population numbers?)

The minimum output of this section should be a PDF document that contains the following elements:
1)	A description and justification of the set of runs you will be doing in these tests.  This should include the range of initial conditions.
2)	A discussion of how you experimentally determined the resolution your code needs to map the phase space.  This is likely only relevant in the agent-based modeling approach, but you should experimentally justify the required population size, grid size, and number of timesteps.  Show tables or plots to justify your choices.   Explain this as a section within a paper.
3)	A presentation the results.  A description describing what you found along with a tabular and/or graphical form for the output from each code.  If appropriate, include error bars in the table.  The focus of this discussion is the how initial conditions lead to specific behavior.  
4)	A discussion of how results of the two codes results are similar or different.  Why are there differences?  Can you normalize them to make the comparison more direct?
5)	Explain what other future analysis should be done on this system to fully understand it?  Are there other initial conditions that need to be explored?  Why would they be important?  

You do NOT need to discuss the code, project background, or implementation.
