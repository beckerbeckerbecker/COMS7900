# Rubric Criterion Score
## ODE code simulates the system
Code works perfectly and is well documented.

1 to 3 minor issues in the code - some documentation missing

Major issues with the code.

Code is doesn't work

## Agent code simulates the system
Code works perfectly and is well documented.

1 to 3 minor issues in the code - some documentation missing

Major issues with the code.

## Runs were done to explore parameter space.
The project fully explores parameter space.  Connections are made between both simulation method.

There are numerous runs of both codes, but there aren't enough to fully understand the space.

One code seems to have enough runs to explore the space, but the other is inadequite.

Only simple runs were done with the codes,   There was not enough data to draw conclusions.

## Results and discussion
Excellent discussion - good graphs and writeup.   

Discussion is good, but perhaps a bit short or missing some minor points.  Either the graphs or analysis may have some minor issues.

Discussion is weak and perhaps a bit short.   More graphs may be needed along with associated analysis. 

Discussion is missing.

## Conclusions
Conclusions are drawn based on the runs and data.  There is a good understanding of the project.

The project conclusions are ok, but perhaps missing some elements.  

The project conclusions are weak.   

There are no conclusions.
