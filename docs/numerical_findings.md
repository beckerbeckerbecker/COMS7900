# Numerical Findings: Three Body Problem Simulations

## Summary
These findings summarize the results of the Three Body Problem simulations, focusing on:
- Sensitivity Analysis: Perturbation results and stability findings.
- Visualization Insights: Graphs and trajectory analyses.
- Critical Points: Regions of chaos and stability.

## Key Results
1. Stability: Certain configurations remain stable under perturbations.
2. Chaos: Small displacements in critical regions result in significant changes.

## Placeholder
- Visual outputs to be added in the `assets/` folder.
